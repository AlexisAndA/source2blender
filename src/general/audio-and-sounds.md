# Audio And Sounds

The Source Engine uses standard audio formats like ``MP3`` and ``WAV``. Most modern tools support these formats so no conversion is required.

::: info
Xbox 360 Source games use the XWV format which is proprietary. Use [VGMStream](https://vgmstream.org/) to convert them to other, more common formats.
