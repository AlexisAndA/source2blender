# Light Warps

In the Source Engine, light warps are one dimensional textures that control how light interacts with a material.

In Team Fortress 2, light warps are used extensively for the characters' illustrative art style.

The default VertexLitGeneric shader offers light warp support in the EEVEE render engine.

The light warp support uses the ``Shader-To-RGB`` shader node which is not available in Cycles.
