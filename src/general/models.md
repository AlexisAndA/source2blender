# Models

Models can be imported to Blender via SourceIO. Go to ``File`` -> ``Import`` -> ``Source Engine Assets`` -> ``GoldSrc/Source Model (.mdl)``.

::: warning
Many models' materials and textures depend on other assets. SourceIO can mount a game's file system in the ``Resources`` tab in the N-menu.
