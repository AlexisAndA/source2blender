# Sound Effects and Voice Lines

## Voice Lines

The voice lines are stored in ``[ game_directory ] / tf / tf2_sound_misc_dir.vpk`` in the ``mp3`` format; However, they're not organized which is not ideal.

Alternatively, you can use the voice lines provided by the [Team Fortress 2 Wiki](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/) which have every voice command described.

## Sound Effects
