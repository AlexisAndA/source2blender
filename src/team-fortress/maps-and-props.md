# Maps And Props

The Source Engine Blender Collection is a project that aims to convert all of the Team Fortress 2 (and other first-party Valve games) maps to Blender, alongside their props. The project's tutorial is posted on [GitHub](https://github.com/hisprofile/blenderstuff/blob/main/Creations/Source%20Engine%20Blender%20Collection.md).

The Source Engine Blender Collection automatically optimizes file sizes by linking shared assets. For a familiar tool check out [OptiPloy](../miscellaneous/optiploy.md).
