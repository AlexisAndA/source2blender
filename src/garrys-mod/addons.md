# Addons

Garry's Mod uses a custom format called ``GMA`` (Garry's Mod Addon) to store addon contents. These files can be extracted with the GMAD.EXE utility which can be found at ``[ game_directory] / bin /``.

::: info
The source code for the utility is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Facepunch/gmad). If you do not own Garry's Mod, you can try compiling the tool yourself from the repository.
