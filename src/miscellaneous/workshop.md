# The Community Workshop

Steam offers game developers the ability to make the workshop available for their titles, for things such as mods and extra content.

Several Source Engine titles like Source Filmmaker and Left 4 Dead 2 have their workshops available with plenty of community-made content.

In order to download these workshop items with tools like [Steam Workshop Downloader](https://steamworkshopdownloader.io/).

::: warning
Several titles do not allow the direct download of their workshop's assets through the public Steam API and may even require the user to own the game. Use [SteamCMD](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD) in these situations.
