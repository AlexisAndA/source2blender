# Rigging

Since the Source Engine is not designed for animation or posing in general (aside from Source Filmmaker), armatures do not have features required for posing and animating. That's why we need to change the armature and add some extra features (like IK) for real use.

::: info
Unfortunately, Source Filmmaker Python rigs can't be exported to Blender.

In the community, the preferred method for rigging is using the built-in Rigify addon as it offers many features that would be time-consuming to implement manually.

Rigify can be challenging to learn and can be time-consuming to set up. To address this, the Rigi-All addon was developed to simplify the process. Below is a brief tutorial on how to use the addon:
