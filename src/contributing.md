# Contributing

This project at its core is just markdown files in a VitePress project.

## Development Server

Previewing the documentation locally can greatly improve your workflow. To set up a live preview:

1. **Install a JavaScript runtime**  
    This project uses [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) but any other runtime should work.

2. **Install project dependencies**  
    Run the following command in your terminal:

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

3. **Start the development server**  
    Use the VitePress CLI or the provided script:

     ```bash
     npm run docs:dev
     ```

Once started, the server will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173). Open this URL in your browser to view the documentation as you edit.

## Text Editing

While any text editor works for this, it's preferred to use a dedicated program with Markdown support. While developing this project, I used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Git

This project is hosted as a Git repository on GitHub. It is essential to know how Git and Git forges work.
