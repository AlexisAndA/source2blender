# Get Started

This documentation is a beginner-friendly guide for converting assets from the [Source Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_(game_engine)) to [Blender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_(software)).

Please note: You should already have some basic familiarity with Blender, as this guide does *not* cover general Blender usage or tutorials.
